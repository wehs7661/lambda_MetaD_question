    "This notebook discusses whether there is a need to deduplicate the overlapped time frames when calculating free energy differences. Specifically, \"overlapped\" or \"duplicate\" time frames are caused in a simulation whenever the simulation is interrupted at some point before reaching the final time frame due to timeout or a GROMACS error. A checkpoint file is required for such simulations to be restarted. As the simulation is typically restarted from the last saved checkpoint rather than exactly where the simulation stops there would be overlapped time frames from the last checkpoint to the point where the simulation stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, here I take the simple system adopted in the previous Problem 1 as the system of interest, which is a molecule composed of 4 uncharged vdW sites. In the folder `Data/Problem_1-1/interrupted_simulation` I saved the output files of a 2D alchemical metadynamics simulation of this system. The simulation was manually interrupted around the middle of the way and was later extended to the expected length of 20 ns. "

However, the COLVAR file of simulation A has 1090382 frames since a fair amount of time frames are overlapped. As can be checked below, there are overlapped time frames because the simulation stopped at 9647.28 ps, while the last checkpoint was only updated to 7839.68 ps since the checkpoint file only updates for every 15 minutes in a GROMACS simulation. As such, when the simulation was restarted with the checkpoint file, it continued from 7839.68 ps instead of 9647.28 ps, leading to duplicate time frames from 7839.68 ps to 9647.28 ps. "

    "Apparently, the overlapped time frames could influence the average bias used for reweighting in free energy calculations. To estimate the free energy difference correctly, I assumed that we should discard the first occurrence of the overlapped time frames such that the correct and continuous CV time series is considered. Notably, given that the statistics of the duplicate time frames should be roughly the same, I do think that the results obtained from the simulation with or without deduplication should not deviate from each other too much. However, as demonstrated below, free energy calculations with data deduplication are statistically different from the ones without any data deduplication. It is also not consistent with the benchmark we got from the simulation without any interruption. "

It is quite common that a simulation is terminated and restarted at some point especially we are running for a long simulation. Therefore, it would be very helpful if you could provide some experiences with this. I appreciate a lot for your insights!"
