    "As described in README of the repository, the system of interest is a molecule composed of 4 vdW sites with 0 net charges. The force constant of the only dihedral in this molecule was increased to 20 kJ/mol to heighten the free energy barrier in the configurational space. I designed this system to show that 2D alchemical metadynamics is able to estimate the free energy difference (between the coupled and uncoupled states) correctly given sufficient sampling in the configurational space when expanded ensemble is not able to. Below is my workflow for showing this ability of 2D alchemical metadynamics."
