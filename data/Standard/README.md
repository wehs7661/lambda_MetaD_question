## `data/Standard`
In this folder, I provide the simulation outputs, including `COLVAR` and `HILLS_LAMBDA` for each repetition. In each subfolder `rep_*`, the folders `histograms` and `FES` store the histogram data and the results of free energy calculations using different block sizes. `method_1.py` is a Python code implementing exactly the same method demonstrated in `Method_1.ipynb` but with an argument parser taking in the following parameters to ease the usage:
```
usage: method_1.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-b B_SIZES [B_SIZES ...]] [-n N_CVS] [-f FACTOR]

This code calculates the free energy profile and assesses the influence of the block size on
its uncertainty.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        The PLUMED input file for reweighting.
  -b B_SIZES [B_SIZES ...], --b_sizes B_SIZES [B_SIZES ...]
                        The min, max, and the spacing of the block sizes, in the units of the
                        STRIDE used to print COLVAR in metadynamics. For example, if this
                        argument is set to 5000 and STRIDE=10 was used in the PLUMED input
                        file for running the metadynamics, then the real block size is 50000
                        simulation steps. If dt = 0.002 ps, this means 100 ps. For this
                        argument, if only one value is given, only one free energy profile
                        based on the given value will be calculated. (Only one fes_*.dat
                        file.)
  -n N_CVS, --n_CVs N_CVS
                        The number of CVs.
  -f FACTOR, --factor FACTOR
                        The factor for converting the block size into ps.
```
To reproduce the results obtained in the folder `Method_1`, in `data/Standard/rep_1`, simply execute `python method_1.py -b 1000`. Similarly, the results for other repetitions can be produced with the same command. 
If multiple values are input through the `-b` flag, different block sizes will be used to analyze the data and all the results will be stored in the folder `FES`. For example, the files in the folder `FES` in each repetition can be generated by the command `python method_1.py -b 100 5000 100`. (Note that executing this command would take about 12-13 minutes.) Additionally, `free_energy_results.txt` and `delta_f_blocks.png` will be produced showing the relationship between the uncertainty and the block size. 

After analyzing all the repetitions, the figures (`free_energy_distribution_20reps.png` and `err_block_20reps.png`) can be produced by executing the command `python plot_all_reps.py`, where `plot_all_reps.py` finds and parses `fes_bsize_*.dat` to plot the results for all the repetitions in one figure. Note that the Python module `natsort` might be required to run `plot_all_reps.py`.
