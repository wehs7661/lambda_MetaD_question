## `data/UPDATE_UNTIL`
In this folder, I provide the simulation outputs, including `COLVAR` and `HILLS_` for each repetition. Similar to `data/Standard`, in each subfolder `rep_*`, the folder `histograms` stores the histogram data, and `method_1.py` was used to analyze to perform free energy calculations. The PLUMED input file for the metadynamics simulation, `plumed.dat` is provided. In the 5 ns metadynamics simulation for each repetition, `UPDATE_UNTIL=4000` was used to stop adding biases at 4 ns. Currently, using `method_1.py`, all the biases were considered when calculating the weighting factors for reweighting and no truncation was used. As can be calculated from `fes_bsize_1000.dat` (produced by `python method_1.py -b 1000` with the block size being 20 ps), the uncertainty of the free energy difference for each replicate was about 0.05 to 0.06 kT, which did not really improve the situation. 

The figure showing the results of all repetitions, `free_energy_distribution_20reps.png` can be generated by running `plot_all_reps.py`.
