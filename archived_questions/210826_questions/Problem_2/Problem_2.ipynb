    "I am aware that I'm using peculiar values for metadynamics parameters and below are the corresponding explanations:\n",
    "- **Large height**: I expected the free energy barrier of removing the water molecules from the binding cavity to be pretty large, so I set the initial Gaussian height as 5 kT (around 12.394 kJ/mol). \n",
    "- **Large bias factor**: Before deciding the value of the bias factor, I conducted some preliminary tests, which are metadynamics simulations with different bias factors only biasing the number of water molecules. As a result, due to the high free energy barrier, a bias factor between 60 to 150 would lead to a flatter distribution in the CV space. With the bias factor being 60, the sampling in the alchemical space was slow, so I decided to use 150, which did lead to a relatively flat distribution in both the alchemical space and the configurational CV space (the number of water molecules). In addition, from the 1D metadynamics simulations, it could be estimated that the largest free energy barrier in the configurational CV space was about 170 kT, so I thought a bias factor around 150 would probably reasonable. (In the paper [Well-Tempered Metadynamics: A Smoothly Converging and Tunable Free-Energy Method](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.020603), it was experimentally found that the error tends to be the lowest given that the bias factor was set such that $k(T+\\Delta T)$ is of the order of magnitude of the barrier height.)\n",
    "- **Small pace**: Given a large bias factor, the Gaussian height would decrease pretty slowly in the simulation. To accelerate the sampling, instead of using a large pace (e.g. 500 simulation steps), I used PACE=10."

    "- **Question 2**: I'm wondering if the parameters related to the wall potential are reasonable. Specifically, an excessivly large force constant might lead to a LINCS error, while a too small force constant could not prevent unphysical sampling effectively. Given the energy penalty set up for now (200 kJ/mol if there are 13 water molecules in the binding cavity), I'm not sure if the parameters require further adjustment."

    "- **Question 3**: As a wall potential is applied in alchemical metadynamics, I am also wondering about the best practices of reweighting the data. In [this tutorial](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/ves-lugano2017-metad.html), actions or keywords such as `HISTOGRAM` and `LOGWEIGHT` were used. However, this is pretty different from the protocol I adopted in the notebook `Problem_1.ipynb` in the same repo. Specifically, previously what I did was use `RESTART=YES` to sum up the metadynamics bias, but I'm not entirely sure if the same protocol can be applied if there is a fixed potential. I'm wondering if you could offer some guidance about how I should modify the protocol I previously used to consider the wall potential when calculating free energy differences and their uncertainties. \n"

    "- **Question 4**: Given the plot of the Gaussian height above, I expect that after 100 ns, the Guassian height of the physical region should be almost stationary, which meets the requirement of the method I used to calculate free energy differences in Problem 1. However, for the unphysical region, the height would probably still be hight since they are less sampled. Since we are only interested in the physical region, I'm wondering if it is still okay to use the same protocol as the one used in `Problem_1.ipynb`. "

    "- **Question 5**: Setting a wall potential as above would prevent the system from exploring any region with `n` (the number of water molecules) over 12, regardless of the $\\lambda$ values. Since 12 water molecules being in the binding cavity is not physical with any $\\lambda$ values, prohibiting exploration of such regions with a wall potential meets my needs. However, to further restrict the sampling region, I'm wondering if there is a way to prohibit the exploration of regions such as $\\lambda=40$ (the uncoupled) and $n=0$ at the same time, which is also likely to be unphysical. Using a simple wall potential does not seem to be able to deal with this, since setting a wall potential at $n=0$ is going to prohibit some physical configurations as well (like $\\lambda=0$ and $n=0$)."
