As the 2D simulation deposited Gaussian biases upon the free energy surface that had been biased by the 1D simulation, the free energy difference estimated by the whole simulation should just be the sum of the two values, which is 140.34 kT. The inconsistency of this value compared to the reference (~148 kT) is certainly what we need to address."

    "- Do you have any other suggestions for changes to be made in trial 3 to improve the free energy calculation of System 3? For your information, the PLUMED input files and Python codes are provided in folders such as `trial_1` and `trial_2` and the `HILLS` files and `COLVAR` files can be obtained from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qkfc21eOsTW5H1kc7tmzUbmRR3uPjo9V/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "- We are also considering a distance restraint between the host and guest molecule using PLUMED. Ideally, we want to make the force constant of the harmonic restraint lambda-dependent such that it's gradually turned on while the van der Waals interaction is gradually decoupled (from states 22 to 40 in our case). The functional form of such a restraint could be as simple as $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(d-d_0)^2$, where $\\lambda$ is the coupling parameter of the van der Waals interaction that ranges from 0 to 1. However, in the current implementation of alchemical metadynamics, `lambda` in the PLUMED input file is the state index rather than coupling parameters. In our case, `lambda` corresponds to integers from 0 to 19 since we have 20 states. I'm wondering if it is possible to retrieve the corresponding coupling parameters from these state indices such that we could apply a $\\lambda$-dependent restraint."
