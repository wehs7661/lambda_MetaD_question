    "In this notebook, we describe our questions about free energy calculations using the block bootstrap method. In a nutshell, we are mainly wondering about the best strategies for deciding how much we should truncate a simulation and how much we should average the biasing potential for reweighting. Below we first demonstrate our workflow for free energy calculations. Then, we'll show the results we got from two different systems we plan to present in our paper. In each folder of `System_2` and `System_3`, we store relevant files such as `plumed.dat`, `plumed_sum_bias.dat`, and `calculate_free_energy.py`. For each system, the HILLS and COLVAR files (which are the inputs for free energy calculations by `calculate_free_energy.py`) can be accessed via [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pf-XI0Hm9O2v0OBJufHzH1ItrUXFW34f?usp=sharing) as interested/needed. Notably, the input files are huge (~5 GB in total) and a free energy calculation (with several different block sizes) could take up to several hours and 30 GB of memory. In each folder, we also attach text files documenting the results of free energy calculations with different sets of parameters. "

In the simulation, in addition to the alchemical variable, we biased this dihedral angle.\n",

    "In System 3 (a host-guest binding complex in the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge), we used 2D alchemical metadynamics (200 ns) to calculate the free energy difference of the alchemical process of decoupling the interactions between the guest molecule and the host molecule, which was a part of the thermodynamic cycle for calculating the binding free energy for the binding complex. In the 2D simulation, the configurational CV was the number of water molecules in the binding cavity (denoted as $N$). In the bound state and the unbound states, typically there are 0.7-5.3 and 4.5-10.5 water molecules in the binding cavity, respectively. Therefore, we set a potential at $N=0.7$ and $N=10.5$, respectively. Since the sampling in regions like $N<0.7$ or $N>10.5$ is likely to be unphysical, we discarded the samples in such regions. (Specifically, when calculating the unbiasing weights for reweighting using `average_bias`, we ignore unphysical samples. We also discard the unphysical samples from `COLVAR_SUM_BIAS` when constructing the histograms.)\n",
